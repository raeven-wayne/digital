<p>These are my small ideas jumbled up into this concept for my blog. This blog will be about seals! I had a hard time deciding what I want to do for this: from red pandas, servals, orangutans, and even fennec foxes! Animals are some of my favorite things to research and I suppose “post” about since this will be a blog. I also had an idea of talking about some mascots I have found cute too. Daisy Lovers, Angel Blue, Mezzo Piano, and Pom Ponette. While these are clothing brands, their characters are so cute I had a severe urge to research them. But at the end of the day, I chose seals to run my blog. They are so fat and such interesting creatures. There’s so many breeds of them too! All in all, they’re all adorable and I cannot wait to blog about them.

	<p>I will be the author, It will not be anonymous. The title of this blog will probably be: Seals: Earth’s Blubber-Filled Darlings. An icon for this blog can be whatever, but I am leaning more towards a seal doing a banana pose. A seal posing like that means they are extremely content, it is like when a cat purrs. Seals stick their tails in the air and balance on their bellies to achieve such a look. I will be drawing it out on Procreate on my Ipad. I have not made a logo in a while, so this will be a fun way to get back into it. The mainpage that everyone will end up on when they go on my blog will be a jumble of seals, which I will draw too! There are many famous seals who will be present on my blog. Niko, Yo, Yuki, Hanako, Kroshik, Agu, and Kyoro are some that will be talked about on this blog. They all have unique personalities and characteristics that make them so cute. While I will be talking about them like a fanpage, I will be providing facts about seals spread throughout the blog for people to read too. This is kind of a pipe dream, but I will strive to achieve it, but I want the posts to be able to be scrolled through. They’d have a cute pic of each seal with some sparkles and such. I like putting stickers on photos, so I will see if I can do that. Pagedolls are fun too! They are little characters that sit on the side of the website as you scroll, like a doll.</p>

	<p>I did some research on older blogs and their aesthetics, I want to achieve a more 2000’s-early 2010’s feel for my blog. Including sidebars of fake ads for seals would be fun, I’d make those as well. Maybe I’ll give each seal their own page. It would have images of them and what aquarium they are being raised in; as well as facts and their growth up until now. The color scheme is going to stay towards more cool, blueish colors that will coincide with the whites and grays of the seals. But, some seals can be a grayish-brown, so I will see how that will go from there. Back to how the posts would be displayed, I think a date-by-date structure would be cool, like someone is really blogging them all. Since this blog is just really more “I Love Seals, I need to make a fan page” the dates on the posts would give the blog that feel.</p>

<div class="b1">
	<p>I put Niko staring at the viewer as an example of him welcoming them onto the page. This is all just an idea right now, so it will look different as I go. Though, that is Niko when he was younger, hence the peach fuzz on his coat. I will be explaining seal growth on this blog too, as a separate fun facts thing.</p>

<div class="b1">
	<p>At the end of the day, seals are such marvelous creatures who have the look of an angel for some reason. They can be so evil for no reason, and galump away as they go eat their fish for the hour. They remind me of a mix between a cat and a dog. Some seals even bark like a dog in a way too! Seals, sea lions, elephant seals, and many more breeds all are amazing animals. They are loved all over the world and always will be. This is just a concept for my blog, everything is subject to change as I will try my best to replicate my ideas onto this blog!</p>
